## Feature Wishlist
- [ ] Android App
  - [ ] Let users save favorite stops
  - [ ] App badge notifs
- [ ] Ask users to verify when they got on, for us to improve predictions
- [ ] Figure out how to get users’ locations, to figure out if they’ve ridden the jeep – goal is to tell the stats
- [ ] Figure out what other companies do with commuting info, there must be a way that they leverage this which is important given that we don’t have good data for this back home
